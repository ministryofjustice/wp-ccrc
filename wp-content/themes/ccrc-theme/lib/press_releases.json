In 2010\/11, in spite of having fewer casework staff and, particularly this year, fewer Commissioners, we have again improved in some areas and held our own in others.

We retained the strongest possible focus on delivery in this, our sixth successive year of cuts and referred 22 cases to the appeal courts without any material increase in queues or waiting times.&#39;<br \/>\n<br \/>\nThe CCRC\u2019s Annual Report and Accounts discusses cases that the Commission has referred to the appeal courts during the year and identifies some trends and issues arising from its work.<br \/>\n<br \/>\nThe highest profile CCRC case reaching the courts during 2011\/12 was that of Sam Hallam, convicted of murder in 2005 after a young man was killed during group disorder in Islington, London. The Commission\u2019s review, conducted with the assistance of officers from Thames Valley Police acting under Commission instruction, revealed serious deficiencies in the original police investigation and led to the quashing of Mr Hallam\u2019s conviction in May 2012.<br \/>\n<br \/>\nIssues identified in the 2011\/12 report include those raised by a number of recent cases involving people who entered the UK as asylum seekers or refugees, but who were wrongly convicted and imprisoned for offences linked to their entry to the UK. The circumstances of these cases were such that the Commission believes there is likely to be a significant number of other people who have been wrongly convicted in a similar manner and will be trying to identify those cases where possible.<br \/>\n<br \/>\nThe casework sections of the report also drawer attention to a lesser known function of the Commission by which it can be called upon by the Court of Appeal Criminal Division, under section 15 of the Criminal Appeal Act 1995, to investigate and report on matters arising from first appeals. Such cases increasingly involve allegations of jurors behaving inappropriately. The report says:<\/p>\n\n<p>&#39;In recent years we have seen a significant increase in the number of section 15 investigations that we have been asked to carry. In 2011\/12, we were asked by the Court to carry out investigations into eight cases involving 17 appellants. Last year we carried out 7 section 15 investigations involving 13 appellants and in earlier years the number was much lower.<br \/>\n<br \/>\n&#39;The issues involved in section 15 investigations are usually complex, often sensitive and the cases always need to be expedited. Section 15 investigations are significant pieces of work that inevitably use resources that we would otherwise deploy in reviewing applications; they are an extremely important part of our work.&#39;<br \/>\n<br \/>\nThe Commission\u2019s Annual Report and Accounts for 2011\/12 was laid before both Houses of Parliament on July 11th.

He was ordered to pay compensation of \u00a320,402.91 to HM Revenue and Customs and to pay \u00a315,000.00 towards prosecution costs.

While the Commission pays close attention to the cases it refers for appeal, once a referral is made the Commission&#39;s formal role is at an end. For the subsequent appeal, the appellant is represented in Court by their own counsel as they would be in any other appeal. Normally the appellant&#39;s legal representative will argue the case based on the Commission&#39;s reasons for referral.

The referrals are made on the grounds that since Messrs Kingston, Reynolds and O\u2019Connell\u2019s trial and appeal, new evidence has come to light which gives rise to a real possibility that the Court of Appeal will not uphold their convictions.&nbsp; The new evidence relates to post-trial allegations made by Mr Neil Putnam, a key prosecution witness in the case.<\/p>\n\n<p>In a BBC TV documentary called \u201cThe Boys Who Killed Stephen Lawrence\u201d, which was broadcast in 2006, Mr Putnam alleged that prior to his arrest, he was told by DS Davidson (a former SERCS officer) of a corrupt link between DS Davidson and Clifford Norris. Mr Norris\u2019s son, David Norris, had at that time been suspected of involvement in the murder of Stephen Lawrence and has since then been convicted of that offence.&nbsp; Mr Putnam also alleged that in 1998 he told MPS officers of this link and that they failed to act upon it.&nbsp; Although later investigations by the Independent Police Complaints Commission and the MPS have found that Mr Putnam\u2019s allegations are unsubstantiated, he has repeated them on a number of occasions.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<p>The Commission has concluded that this new evidence raises substantial doubts as regards Mr Putnam\u2019s credibility and reliability and that, as a result, there is a real possibility that the Court of Appeal will conclude that Mr Putnam\u2019s evidence at Messrs Kingston, Reynolds and O\u2019Connell\u2019s trial can no longer safely be relied upon and that their convictions are in consequence unsafe and should be quashed.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<p>The purpose of the Commission\u2019s review has solely been to establish whether or not there is new evidence which gives rise to a real possibility that Messrs Kingston, Reynolds and O\u2019Connell\u2019s convictions will be quashed.&nbsp; The Commission has not itself specifically investigated the issue of whether there was corruption in the initial Stephen Lawrence murder investigation.&nbsp; It is right to say, however, that during the course of its review it has found nothing which lends support to the allegations which Mr Putnam has made.<br \/>\n<br \/>\nMessrs Kingston, Reynolds and O\u2019Connell are represented by Kaim Todner Solicitors of 11 Bolt Court, London.

Messrs Drury and Clark were co-defendants in a trial at the Central Criminal Court in November 1999. Mr Drury was convicted of conspiracy to supply a class B drug and two counts of perverting the course of public justice. He was sentenced to a total of 11 years imprisonment. His sentence was later varied on appeal to eight years. Mr Clark was convicted of two counts of conspiracy to supply Class B drugs and two counts of perverting the course of public justice. He was sentenced to a total of twelve years in prison. His sentence was later varied on appeal to ten years.<br \/>\n<br \/>\nAt the time of the offences for which they were convicted, Messrs Drury and Clark were police officers serving with the South East Regional Crime Squad. Both men were granted leave to appeal against their convictions and sentences in February 2001. In April 2001 their appeals against conviction were dismissed by the Court of Appeal. Both appeals against sentence led to their sentences being reduced.<\/p>\n\n<p>Mr Drury applied to the Criminal Cases Review Commission in 2001 for a review of his sentence. The Commission did not refer the matter to the Court of Appeal.<br \/>\n<br \/>\nMr Drury and Mr Clark then made a joint application to the Commission in 2002.<br \/>\n<br \/>\nThe Commission decided to refer their convictions to the Court of Appeal because it was of the opinion that non-disclosure of prosecution material may have significantly disadvantaged the defence such as to raise a real possibility that the convictions would not be upheld on appeal.<\/p>\n\n<p>In 2010, the Court of Appeal quashed their convictions and ordered a retrial on some of the counts on the indictment.&nbsp; In October 2011, Messrs Clark and Drury were formally acquitted of all charges after the Crown offered no evidence at the retrial.<\/p>\n\n<h4>Notes for editors<\/h4>\n\n<p>1.&nbsp;The Criminal Cases Review Commission is an independent body set up under the Criminal Appeal Act 1995.
